# Wannabee

Wannabee is a retro and anachronistic Jekyll theme inspired by older computers.

Wannabee is being created for Hack Club's [Tonic](https://tonic.hackclub.com/), a [You Ship, We Ship (YSWS)](https://hackclub.com/ship/) about building Jekyll themes.

## Inspirations

In no particular order, Wannabee is inspired by:

<!-- TODO: MORE LIST ITEMS  -->

- [int10h.org](https://int10h.org).
- [The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/).
- the fictional operating system "piOS" from the game [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com/).
- [BOOTSTRA.386](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386).
- people that wish they could've worked somewhere like the old Bell Labs.

<!-- holy hell, BOOTSTRA.386 may be the coolest repo i have ever come across. the scope has literally blown my mind. also used in nora's https://retrospect.hackclub.com/dos -->

But this is a _tiny_ list. For more of Wannabee's inspirations, please visit the evolving [moodboard](./inspo/moodboard/moodboard.png).

<!-- TODO: i should probably write some code to manage PureRef -->
